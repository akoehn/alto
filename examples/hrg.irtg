/* A synchronous grammar that translates between strings and
   semantic representations, represented as graphs.

   Try parsing this sentence: "the boy wants to go"

   And parsing this graph: (w / want-01  :ARG0 (b / boy)  :ARG1 (g / go-01 :ARG0 b))

   The grammar can translate the sentence "the boy wants the girl to believe that the boy likes the girl",
   which is modeled after Chiang et al., ACL 2012, Figure 2. A crucial difference is that our grammar
   does not attempt to map the pronouns in Chiang et al.'s example to the same nodes as "the boy"
   and "the girl", because this can't be done compositionally anyway. Note also that "want3" introduces
   a node for the agent of the object-control verb; it is connected to
   the w node using a "dummy" edge.

   For the reverse direction, try parsing the following graph:
   (w_5 / want-01  :ARG0 (subj_6 / boy)  :ARG1 (vcomp_7 / believe-01  :ARG0 (obj_8 / girl)  :ARG1 (xcomp_6_3 / like-01  :ARG0 (subj_5_2_4 / boy)  :ARG1 (obj_6_3_5 / girl)))  :dummy obj_8)
