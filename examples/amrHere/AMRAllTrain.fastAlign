In reality humans contribute about 5 % to global worming in terms of CO2 release into the atmosphere . Yes it is true that we are responsible for this number and trying to minimize it in whatever way we can , but humans are not ultimately the source of global worming . It is arrogant of us to think that we can effect the ecosystem of the world in such a drastic way in only 20 years . Science is divided on the issues with scientists in government labs reporting that global warming is an imminent threat caused by humans and only we can save the planet while scientists at universities and private organizations generally suggest that man is not the ultimate cause and in reality contributes little . The IPCC has published documentation and recommendations about global warming at regular intervals and it was not until one of their more recent publications that they completely overturned their previous data showing global warming to be natural in favor of new data that showed global warming to be human caused . The problem is that they used the same relative data set and simply changed the way it is viewed to maximize the human contribution . They have also been known to falsify information to suit their purposes and destroy information that proves them incorrect . ||| multi-sentence contribute-01 human release-01 carbon-dioxide percentage-entity 5 atmosphere warm-01 globe in-reality contrast-01 true and responsible-41 we number this try-01 minimize-01 possible way whatever source warm-01 globe human - ultimate think-01 we possible affect-01 ecosystem world drastic such temporal-quantity 20 year only arrogance divide-02 science contrast-01 report-01 person have-org-role-91 lab government-organization govern-01 scientist and threaten-01 warm-01 globe imminent cause-01 human possible save-02 we only planet suggest-01 person have-org-role-91 and university organization private scientist and cause-01 - man ultimate contribute-01 little reality general issue and publish-01 organization name "IPCC" and document-01 recommend-01 warm-01 globe rate-entity-91 interval regular overturn-01 data previous show-01 natural complete cause-01 favor-01 data show-01 cause-01 human new until - thing recent more publish-01 one include-01 thing publish-01 and use-01 they set data relative-41 same-41 change-01 view-01 simple maximize-01 thing contribute-01 human problem know-01 and falsify-01 they information suit-01 purpose destroy-01 information prove-01 right-41 - also

My own conclusion is that terms like " multiverse " have no separate reality with respect to a singular concept whilst the criteria for " reality " concern explanation of what we call " events " in the single universe . I am saying that the occurence of " life " is not an " event " in the usual sense because events presuppose " observers " who classify them as such . ( Observation in " our minds eye " is cognitive sleight of hand ) Note also the term " multi " implies " one who classifies or counts " and we can ask again who is this other than ourselves ? ||| multi-sentence conclude-01 i have-03 - term multiverse reality separate respect-01 concept singular concern-02 criteria reality explain-01 thing call-01 we event universe single say-01 event - occur-01 life sense usual cause-01 presuppose-00 event person observe-01 classify-01 cognitive sleight hand observe eye mind we and note-02 imperative you term multi imply-01 one classify-01 count-01 also possible ask-01 we this amr-unknown except-00 again

Rather than take a reductionist view proposing infinite , slightly different universes that somehow interact ( alah M-Theory ) , allow for strong emergence via the Landauer-Lloyd analysis of flaws in the of the Laplace ' s demon argument that supports reductionists . Basically this states the final outcome of a system may not be soley defined by outcomes written into the basic laws of physics * a gazzillion atoms , but there can be " a cosmic imperative " written into the laws of nature ( Paul Davies - Macquarie Uni - Sydney , Australia - Emergent biological principles and the computational resources of the universe , Complexity vol 10 ( 2 ) , p1 " ||| multi-sentence contrast-01 view-01 imperative you reduction propose-01 universe infinite differ-02 slight interact-01 amr-unknown allow-01 emerge-02 strong analyze-01 name "Landauer-Lloyd" flaw-01 argument theory name "Laplace's" "demon" support-01 person reduce-01 state-01 analyze-01 contrast-01 possible - define-01 outcome outcome final system write-01 law basic physic sole possible exist-01 imperative cosmic write-01 law nature person name "Paul" "Davies" page publication name "Emergent" "Biological" "Principles" "and" "the" "Computational" "Resources" "of" "the" "Universe" publication name "Complexity" ordinal-entity 10 volume
So basically ultra complex systems can produce wierd outcomes ; such as rocks , intelligent life or high temperature superconductors all from the same raw materials - simply arranged slightly differentally .
