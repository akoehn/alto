This is a tool for working with Interpreted Regular Tree Grammars (IRTGs). This tool supports natural-language parsing, translation, and training with a wide variety of grammar formalisms, based on an efficient implementation of tree automata.

Please see the [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/tclup/alto/wiki/Home) for more details and consult the [Downloads](https://bitbucket.org/tclup/alto/downloads) for a current release.

If you wish to use the IRTG tool seriously, it may be worth reading up on the theoretical background: [Koller & Kuhlmann, IWPT 2011](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~koller/showpaper.php?id=irtg-11); [Koller & Kuhlmann, TAG+ 2012](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~koller/showpaper.php?id=tag-irtg).

Notice that the IRTG tool is currently a research prototype. It is limited in two essential ways:

* Many algorithms in the tool are not implemented as efficiently as they could be. We are actively working on improving the performance of these algorithms, and are hoping to release a new version of the tool soon.

* Although we have done extensive testing, we expect that there are still bugs in the IRTG tool. If you find bugs, we would appreciate hearing about them in the [IRTG tool discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/irtg-discussion)
