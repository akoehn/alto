This is a tool for working with Interpreted Regular Tree Grammars (IRTGs). This tool supports natural-language parsing, translation, and training with a wide variety of grammar formalisms, based on an efficient implementation of tree automata.

Please see the [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/tclup/irtg/wiki/Home) for more details.
